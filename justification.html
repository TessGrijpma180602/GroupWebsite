			Welcome on the justification page! Here we will explain how and why this website has come together as it is now. The Urthly <br> website communicates the feeling of being clean and sustainable, and based on this, all design and website-flow <br>deciscions have been made. Below you will find specifically how it all came together.

			 As Urthly is a brand with many different aspects, such as creating the content, making perfect website-flow, coding the website and selecting the best kind of products to sell, the Urthly team has made a clear division of tasks within building this website. We are a group of students who learn a lot from each other and make sure everyone is present in the entire process, but everyone is responsible for their own aspects of the website. Below are the team members described with their own aspects and responsibilities from the website, to show the entire team has made an equal and essentail contribution. <br><br>Joëlle Donkers: On the Urthly Website, Joëlle is responsible for selecting the best collection of sustainable products. She will look into the best pricing, the right amount of products per box, and keeping it exciting for our customers to buy our Discovery Box. She is also Head of Marketing, and looks after our social media accounts. <br><br> Felipe Sperling: As the website requires a few pages, Felipe is responsible for creating the best website-flow. He researched and tested our prototypes, and drew conclusions from this to come up with a plan to improve  the Urthly website. A first paper version turned into a specific prototype, and that's how he developed a well-flowing plan for the entire website, together with team member Floris. <br><br> Floris Brugman: Together with his teammate Felipe, Floris was also responsible to creating a nice website flow and did some tests to make sure people would use the website as we thought they would. If there were any problems, he would make sure to find solution's. He makes sure the entire website is in line with the mission and vision Urthly tries to carry.<br><br> Tess Grijpma: Tess is one of the two teammembers who are responsible for the back-end of the website, which means she is responsible for coding everything on the home and products page that Floris and Felipe create, test and improve. She makes sure the code is correct and works as the prototype.<br><br> Anouk van den Hout: Together with Tess, Anouk is also responsible for coding the website and making sure everything works as desired. She lays the focus on the justification and contact page, where the plans and improvements from Floris and Felipe all come together nicely. Together with the team, she makes sure that the website communicates Urthly's vision, mission and products nicely.
